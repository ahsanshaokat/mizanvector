      "We propose the Mizan Balance Function, a scale-invariant mathematical formulation designed to quantify proportional balance between two values. The function originates from the conceptual idea of mīzān (balance), which emphasizes proportional fairness rather than absolute magnitude. Unlike classical measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) that treat identical absolute differences equally across scales, the Mizan function measures relative imbalance, making it particularly useful in domains where proportional accuracy is more meaningful than raw error.\n",

Experiments on toy datasets (e.g., Kaggle student scores, house-price prediction) illustrate that integrating Mizan with standard losses yields more stable learning and more interpretable error behavior compared to MSE alone.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Machine learning models must compare predictions with targets using mathematical functions that quantify error or similarity. The most widely used metric, Mean Squared Error (MSE), penalizes the absolute difference between two values. However, in many real-world cases, absolute error does not reflect meaningful imbalance, especially when values differ by scale.\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "A 2-point error in exam scores is severe when the true score is 10, but negligible when the true score is 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A 1 mg dosage error is dangerous when the correct dose is 2 mg, but harmless when the correct dose is 200 mg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A 5% probability error is serious for low probabilities (rare events) but minor for large ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fairness metrics, the same absolute accuracy gap affects smaller groups more than larger groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These cases highlight the limitations of absolute-error-based metrics.\n",
      "To address this, we introduce the Mizan Balance Function — a proportional, scale-invariant measure of imbalance. The function evaluates how large an error is relative to the magnitude of the quantities being compared. Therefore, while MSE measures “how far,” Mizan measures “how unfair” or “how unbalanced.”\n",
      "We further generalize this idea into a loss function suitable for deep learning and demonstrate its usefulness across various applications.\n",

      "3. Related Work\n",
      "Similarity and loss functions are foundational to machine learning, particularly in regression, metric learning, and optimization. The classical Mean Squared Error (MSE) remains the dominant choice for regression due to its convexity and ease of optimization. However, MSE is highly sensitive to scale and outliers, which can distort learning dynamics in multi-scale or imbalanced data (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Variants such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Huber Loss, and Log-Cosh Loss have attempted to mitigate these limitations by reducing sensitivity to large residuals or nonlinearizing the error landscape.\n",
      "In similarity-based modeling, cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, Jaccard index, and Dice coefficients offer alternatives for comparing vectors or sets. However, these metrics typically assume normalized representations or binary structures, making them less suitable for raw numerical comparisons with varying scales.\n",
      "Relative error-based metrics, such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Symmetric MAPE (sMAPE), attempt to incorporate proportional balance. Nonetheless, these metrics are known to behave poorly when true values approach zero and often require ad-hoc stability corrections.\n",
      "More recently, fairness-aware performance metrics—such as equalized odds, demographic parity, and disparity ratios—compare model behavior across demographic subgroups by measuring differences in performance metrics. These measures typically operate on absolute differences, making them limited in scenarios where proportional imbalance is more meaningful.\n",
      "In contrast, the Mizan Balance Function introduces a unified, mathematically grounded formulation that quantifies relative imbalance, remains bounded, exhibits scale-invariance, and supports differentiable optimization. This dual capability—as both a similarity measure and a loss function—distinguishes it from prior approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Proposed Method\n",
      "4.1 The Mizan Balance Similarity\n",
      "Given two real-valued quantities xxx and yyy, the Mizan Balance Similarity quantifies proportional closeness as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "where p∈[1,2] controls strictness, and ε\\varepsilonε is a small stabilizing constant.\n",
      " This similarity lies strictly in the interval 0≤Smizan≤1.\n",
      "4.2 The Mizan Balance Loss\n",
      "For optimization, the complementary loss function is defined as:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This loss penalizes relative imbalance rather than raw deviation.\n",
      "4.3 Combined Loss for ML Training\n",
      "To retain the strengths of both absolute and relative error modeling, a combined objective is proposed:\n",
