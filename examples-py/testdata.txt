Mizan Balance Function Test Document

Section 1: Introduction
Mizan is a scale-aware similarity metric designed to overcome limitations
of cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. It handles multi-scale data,
outliers, and proportional error.

Section 2: Example Content
Ahsan Shaokat is the creator of the Mizan Balance Function. This document
provides examples for testing chunking and vector similarity.

Section 3: Mixed Content
Cosine similarity ignores magnitude. Euclidean distance explodes on outliers.
Mizan similarity is robust, proportional, and suitable for modern embedding
techniques.

Section 4: Conclusion
Mizan is useful for large text search, RAG retrieval, embeddings, and similarity
learning.
